# The button that just feels right.

Buttons are one of the most important elements in user interfaces. They serve as a key call-to-action (CTA) point, guiding users to take meaningful actions, such as signing up, purchasing, or navigating. Ensuring a button feels right—both visually and interactively—can significantly improve user engagement and drive better results.

## The Crucial Role of User Experience (UX)

Let's quickly dive into the role of UX. In today’s world, user experience (UX) has become one of the key factors in determining the success of any digital product. Whether you're building a simple website, a complex web app, or a mobile application, how users interact with and perceive your product will ultimately decide its fate.

A great UX leads to:

**Increased engagement:** Users are more likely to interact with an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface.  
**Higher retention:** Satisfied users are more likely to return and use your product repeatedly.  
**Better conversion rates:** An enjoyable experience translates to higher conversions, whether that's sign-ups, purchases, or any other desired action.

To craft a delightful user experience, developers need powerful tools to quickly and effectively style their applications. This is where **Tailwind CSS** comes in.

## Tailwind CSS: Faster Styling for Your Application

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that lets developers write styles directly in their HTML or JSX. Unlike traditional CSS approaches where you define separate class styles in external files, Tailwind allows you to apply pre-defined classes directly in your markup.

Key benefits of Tailwind:

**Speed:** No need to switch between files or think about class names. Simply apply utility classes and move on.  
**Consistency:** With pre-built utility classes, you can maintain a consistent design system effortlessly.  
**Customization:** Tailwind’s configuration allows you to customize themes, spacing, colors, and more, ensuring flexibility while keeping things structured.

## Built-in Features of Tailwind CSS

Tailwind doesn’t just help you write faster CSS; it also provides **out-of-the-box features** to enhance user experience:

**Animations:** Easily add hover, focus, and active state animations to make components more interactive.  
**Shadows & text shadows:** Create depth and focus using built-in shadow utilities.  
**Insets & positioning:** Quickly control layout and spacing with utilities like `inset`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

With all these utilities, Tailwind empowers developers to create engaging user interfaces with minimal effort.

## Example: A Reusable Button Component with Tailwind

Let’s look at a practical example: a reusable **Button** component styled with Tailwind. This component uses
**class-variance-authority (CVA)** for managing different variants and sizes, allowing us to create buttons with
consistent styles throughout our application.

### Button Component Code

```js
import PressableButtonPreview from "./pressable-button-preview"
```

<PressableButtonPreview />


```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot"
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-ring disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:size-4 [&_svg]:shrink-0",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default:
          "bg-primary text-primary-foreground shadow hover:bg-primary/90",
        destructive:
          "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-destructive/90",
        outline:
          "border border-input bg-background shadow-sm hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        secondary:
          "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-9 px-4 py-2",
        sm: "h-8 rounded-md px-3 text-xs",
        lg: "h-10 rounded-md px-8",
        icon: "h-9 w-9",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
)

export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  asChild?: boolean
}

const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
    const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button"
    return (
      <Comp
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    )
  }
)
Button.displayName = "Button"

export { Button, buttonVariants }
