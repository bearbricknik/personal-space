            Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dominik, a previous automative & engine student at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. During
            the pandamic I teached myself how to write code and since then I am in various software projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my journey with creating browser extensions in plain JavaScript with the great help of my team as
            I struggled with HTML and CSS at that time. I then moved on to do scraping projects with Python and NodeJS.
            Ultimately I found my passion in web development and started to learn ReactJS and NextJS and additionally
            API Design. Finally, I am now working on my own projects.

      </div>
    </ScrollArea>
